# AuthTest
This is test of using "new" authentication system from Spring Boot 2.7
Was added authentication using Telegram bot
### 27.10 
Was fixed bug with Telegram bot: after pushing callback query button in message, a record in DB was created, which is why you could authenticate without confirmation
